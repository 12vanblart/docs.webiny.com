There are many ways in how you can install Webiny and create your first website. By far, the simplest way is creating a Webiny Cloud account. This tutorial will cover that step.

> For alternative ways of installing Webiny and creating your website, you can follow the more advanced [developer tutorials](/docs/developer-tutorials/local-setup).

## 1. Create your account

Head on to [https://www.webiny.com/](https://www.webiny.com/) and click the `Get Started` link in the top right corner.
The first step is to create an account. Once your account is ready, you'll be redirected to a screen called Site Manager.

### Site Manager

Site Manager is a place where you manage all your websites. You can have one, or you can have many website, it's fully up to you how many you create.

## 2. Create your website

First time you enter Site Manager, where won't see any websites, so, let's create one.

!TODO! > Add image

You should see a big green button on the page, if you click it, it will bring up the new website creation dialog. The form asks for a website name, and it will auto generate a temp domain name for you. Until you connect your own domain name, you can use the temp one to reach your site.

Go ahead and fill out the form and when ready press the submit button.

It might take a few seconds, and your website will be created. On the final screen you will be presented with the user credentials for your website.

> **Note:** Site Manager allows you to create multiple websites. Every website has its own set of users that can manage the content. By default, upon website creation, a new admin account will be associated with the website.

## 3. Access your website

Open a new tab and type in, or paste, your temp domain name. You should see a nice looking welcome page, with several links to articles which will get you started on your first steps to managing your website.

If you navigate to "/admin" page, for example `https://my-side.z1.webiny.com/admin`, this will open the administration which you can access with the credentials presented to you upon website creation from the previous section.
