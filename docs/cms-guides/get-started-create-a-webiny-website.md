There are many ways in how you can install Webiny and create your first website. By far, the simplest way is creating a Webiny Cloud account. This tutorial will cover that step.

> For alternative ways of installing Webiny, you can follow the more advanced [developer tutorial](#).

## 1. Create your account

Head on to [https://www.webiny.com/](https://www.webiny.com/) and click the Sign Up link in the top right corner. 
The first step is to create an account. Once you're account is ready, you'll be redirected to a screen called Site Manager.

### Site Manager
Site Manager is a place where you manage all your websites. You can have just one website, or you can have many, it's fully up to you how many you create. 

## 2. Create your website

First time you enter Site Manager, where won't see any websites, so, let's create one.  

You should see a big green button on the page, if you click it, it will bring up the new website creation dialog. The form asks for pretty basic information, but one of the fields that's important to understand is the "hostname".

> **What is a: Hostname or a Domain Name** This is the name of your domain. Few examples of a hostname are: www.domain.com or site.domain.com.

> **NOTE**: Webiny does not support top level domains. Meaning domains like: domain.com, example.com, without the "www" in front are not supported.

## 3. Access your website

Once the site is created, it will be accessible under the temp domain name, until you point your custom domain to Webiny. The details regarding custom domains are covered in the next step.

At the moment you can access your domain name by clicking the three dots next to the domain in Site Manager and selecting the "Administration" option. Or you can just navigate to your temp domain name "/admin", for example: https://my-side.z1.webiny.com/admin
