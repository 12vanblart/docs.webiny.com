Like many other apps, and technologies, there is a learning curve involved. We've put big effort in making all the tutorials and guides clear enough so that people from different backgrounds are able to follow along.

These guides do not require you to have any technical skills. If you can use standard day to day applications like email and a word processor, you will have no problems in tackling Webiny and having a great experience while at it.

> **Tip**: Joining the [Community Forum](https://community.webiny.com/) is beneficial for newcomers as it's a great place to get help and explore the current knowledge articles.
