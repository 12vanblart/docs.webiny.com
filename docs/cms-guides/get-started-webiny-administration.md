Webiny administration, or just "admin" for short, is the control system behind your website. This is the place where you create and manage your content, as well as create additional users and give them access to your administration.

Each website you have has it's own administration, and all the pages and users that you create under one website are only part of that particular website, they are not shared across other websites you might host on Webiny.

## Main menu

The administration by default has 2 main section, **Content** and **Security**. Under each section there are several options that you can access. To open up the main menu, and view the
sections, click the menu button on the top left corner.

The **Content** section is where you are managing your content, in terms of your pages, as well as page categories.

The **Security** section is where you can see a list of all the users and their permissions to the particular website. This is the place where you can create additional users and give them access.

> **Tip**: Once you're done with the "Get Started" section of this guide, we encourage you to explore the other sections in the left menu. They do a deeper dive into the specific sections or Webiny administration. There are many features that you will find beneficial and will have a positive impact on your experience in building your website.

## Search bar

You will notice a big search field inside the admin interface. This is the universal search that allows you to search through different data, like pages, page categories and users. Just focus on the bar, start typing and select one of the items from the list.

## My account

In the right corner, you should see a circular shape with your initial on it. This is your user menu. Click the shape to open the menu. In the menu you'll find few things. You can first of all, click on your name, to access your user account area, from where you can set your avatar, change your password, as well as your basic user information.

From the user menu, you can also toggle dark/light mode. This changes the look and feel of the administration. Note that this change is only reflected to the current browser.

Other options present in the menu are for accessing the support page, way to send some feedback to our team, in case you have any comments you want to share, and finally the option to log out from your admin account.

## Summary

Those are the main section of the administration. In the next section we will cover the steps required to create a page category.
