## Creating a page

To create a page, on the page list screen, click the green plus button in the lower right corner. This will bring up a dialog showing a list of your page categories. Click on the category in which you want to place the page.

At this point you should be redirected to the page editor. This is where you build your page.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

### Page title

When you enter the page editor screen, for a new page, the page is name "Untitled". That title is displayed on the very top of the screen. Click on the name, to rename the page. Feel free to name it anything you want. Even emojis are supported ðŸŽ‰.

  </video>
</div>

### Adding a block

After you've named your page it's time add a first **block**. All content on your page must be placed inside blocks. To add a block, just click the big green button. A list of blocks will appear. There is a set of predefined blocks, and you can always create your own blocks that you can later reuse across other pages.

On the block list, select one of blocks to add it to your page.

  </video>
</div>

### Adding elements

Once you have your block on the screen, you can then open the elements bar to start adding content to your page. Elements are things like text, images, lists, youtube videos, and similar.

In addition to those elements, under the layouts category you will find things like rows, columns and spacers. You can use those to better organize your content on the page.

As a practice try adding a row, then place 2 columns inside the row. Inside the first column try adding an image element, and inside the second place a text. Have a look at the example below of how that can look like.

<div class="video-container">
  <video width="800" loop>
    <source src="/docs/assets/cms-guides/cms-basic-editor-editing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

Once you are happy with how your content looks, you can do some final house keeping items before you publish your page.

> **Tip:** When adding elements, you can use drag&drop to place elements inside your page, but also, in case you click the `plus` icon inside a column, then you can just click on the element you want, and it will be added inside that column, no need to drag it.

## Page settings

In the editor, click on the settings cog, this will bring up page settings. It's recommended that you fill out some of the information there, like the SEO form, as this will make your page rank better inside search engines like Google.

Items under the social tab control how your page looks like when share on social networks like Facebook and Twitter.

Once you're done with this section, you can publish your page.

<div class="video-container">

    <source src="/docs/assets/cms-guides/cms-basic-editor-page-settings.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</div>

## Publish page

To publish a page, just press on the orange button in the editor, and your page will be live.

## Next steps

And with this we end the getting started tutorial. The next step is optional, but highly recommended, as it guides you through the steps of adding a custom domain to your side. Using the temp domain is ok for starters, but over time you might want to have a custom domain that is branded to your name or your business.

Besides the custom domain, there are many more articles on this page that you will find in the left menu. Have a look, the more articles you master the better your website will become ;)
